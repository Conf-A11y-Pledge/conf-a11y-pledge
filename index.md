# Conference Accessibility Pledge

## Introduction

The accessibility of an event is not a "nice to have". Everyone has a right to an inclusive conference experience regardless of disability or level of ability - Attendees, speakers, volunteers, guests, and organizers. Everyone involved with a conference should be treated equitably and with dignity. 


## 

## The pledge

We will accept and respect people of all abilities at the conference, including attendees, guests, speakers, volunteers and co-organizers.

We will be **intentionally** and **deliberately** inclusive to avoid the risk of unintentionally excluding people with disabilities from the conference.

We acknowledge that not all disabilities are visible - we will educate ourselves about various accessibility needs.

We are aware that mistakes happen. If we make a mistake, we will do everything possible to fix the problem as promptly as possible.

We shall post an accessibility statement on our website about specific accessibility information for the conference. 

## Diversity 

Diversity is important to the success of any event. To be truly diverse, a whole range of groups that are often excluded should be included. Such groups include: 

* Different genders
* Different sexual orientation
* Different ethnic and cultural background
* Different socio-economic background

While inclusion isn't solely about disability, this pledge is specifically about accessibility for people with disabilities.

## Background

[Nic Steenhout](https://incl.ca) had a few bad experiences as a speaker with a disability at conferences that weren't particularly accessible. He spoke to several other conference speakers, or attendees, with disabilities who reported bad experiences as well. In conjunction with [Denis Boudreau](https://about.me/dboudreau), they decided to help and guide conference organizers become more accessible. And the Accessibility Pledge began.
